# TicTacToe - Java

I made this amazing Tic Tac Toe game using Core Java (UI Desktop Application). It is a game between two players where each player is assigned a marking symbol X or O.

## Rules
* Two players take turns: placing 'X' and 'O' marks in empty spaces on a 3x3 square grid.
* Player with the 'X' mark starts first. The first player to place 3 marks in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row wins the game.
* If all spaces are filled, the game ends in a draw.
